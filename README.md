first code is euler method
In mathematics and computational science, the Euler method (also called forward Euler method) is a first-order numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial value.
The second one is modified eulers method
The simple Euler method uses the ODE to evaluate the slope of the tangent at A. The modified Euler method evaluates the slope of the tangent at B, as shown, and averages it with the slope of the tangent at A to determine the slope of the improved step.
The third one is rung kutta 4th
The task is to find value of unknown function y at a given point x. The Runge-Kutta method finds approximate value of y for a given x. Only first order ordinary differential equations can be solved by using the Runge Kutta 4th order method.
